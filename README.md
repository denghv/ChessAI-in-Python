Further development ideas
Ordering the moves (ex. looking at checks and/or captures) should make the engine much quicker (because of the alpha-beta pruning).
Keeping track of all the possible moves in a given position, so that after a move is made the engine doesn't have to recalculate all the moves.
Evaluating kings placement on the board (separate in middle game and in the late game).
Book of openings.
